## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwind.com/) - For styles
- [Yet another react lightbox](https://yet-another-react-lightbox.com/) - for Lightbox
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations
- Masonry Layout
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Actually this challenge was relatively simple but I did learn some new things:

 <ul>
    <li>How to make a masonry layout, I learned it using the react-masonry-css library.</li>
    <li>How to make a lightbox with yet-another-react-lightbox.</li>
 </ul>


### Continued development

In future projects I would like to improve on how to handle the css absolute and relative properties, also to investigate techniques to improve the performance of applications using nextjs.

### Useful resources

- [Yet another react lightbox](https://yet-another-react-lightbox.com/) - This library I used to lightbox, helped me very much.
- [Masonry Layout](https://github.com/paulcollett/react-masonry-css#readme) - This is an amazing library for build the masonry layout very easy.
